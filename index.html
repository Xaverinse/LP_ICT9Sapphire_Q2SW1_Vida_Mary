	<h1 class="team">Team Plasma</h1>
	<p> They are a villainous team from the Pokemon Black and White & Black 2 and White 2 games, with their organization based in the Unova region. Team Plasma's original goal was to "liberate" all Pokémon from their Trainers, by either manipulating the Trainer to release their Pokémon, or by theft., Team Plasma's true leader, exploited the group in an attempt to rule Unova as the only one with Pokémon.

Two years after Team Plasma's defeat, the group returned with a new goal to rule Unova by freezing it using Kyurem. A small group from the original Team Plasma was still loyal to N, and took it upon themselves to take care of weakened Pokémon in the wild.</p>
